# 💼 Production & Inventory Performance Dashboard
This fictional Power BI project for the frozen bakery industry visualizes KPIs such as production attainment, order fulfillment, scrap, cost, and capacity utilization across four product families and regions, delivering data-driven insights to support planning and decision-making in a realistic business context.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Production & Order Analytics:** Track **Production Attainment Rate**, **Order Fulfillment Rate**, and **Scrap Rate** to monitor operational performance.  
- **Cost & Capacity Insights:** Evaluate **Total Production Cost** and **Capacity Utilization Rate** to identify efficiency gaps.  
- **Contribution Analysis:** Analyze each **product family’s contribution** to total production, adapting dynamically to filters like region, SKU, and month/year.  
- **Trend Analysis:** Detect fluctuations in key KPIs and investigate root causes with month-by-month comparisons.
  
## 📊 Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop (Data visualization, dashboard design, and data modeling)
- Power Query (Data cleaning, transformation)
- DAX (All custom measures and KPIs)
- Excel (Initial data structure design and preparing the fictional dataset)
- GitHub (Version control and project documentation)
  
## 💡 Insights & Trend Storytelling
**🌪 July Dip (Planned Production Challenge)**
  - Production dropped sharply (**Attainment 63,4%**) and **Capacity Utilization fell to 79,25%**.  
  - Order fulfillment slowed (**75,1%**) and scrap rose (**5,5%**).  
  - **Temporary equipment downtime and minor workforce constraints caused the drop in production and efficiency**, explaining the July dip.
    
**📈 August Recovery**
  - Production and order fulfillment rebounded (**87% attainment, 97,8% OFR**)  
  - Scrap reduced (**2,5%**) and capacity utilization rose (**107,8%**).  
  - Capacity values exceeding 100% are **explained by overtime or additional shifts** to meet production demand.
    
**📊 Contribution to Total Product %**
  - Month-by-month: May 0,17, Jun 0,40, Jul 0,29, Aug 0,14 (total = 100%)  
  - Correctly reflects **distribution of production volumes across months** and dynamically responds to filters.
    
**💰 Cost & Efficiency Observations**
  - Total Production Cost reflects **monthly activity and partial months** (May & Aug).  
  - July cost per unit is likely higher due to low production and high scrap.  
  - August shows improved efficiency and normalized unit costs.
    
**📦 Inventory & Turnover**
  - Inventory turnover slowed in July (low production, high scrap), leading to higher DIO.  
  - August shows stabilization and faster stock movement.
    
## 🧩 Analytical Approach
This dashboard goes beyond basic visualization — it focuses on **measuring the right metrics** to support accurate decision-making.  
Key calculations, such as **service level**, **inventory turnover ratio**, and **production cycle adherence**, are designed to **reflect real supply chain dynamics** rather than relying on static data.

By structuring measures with DAX, the dashboard ensures:
- **Consistency**: All KPIs are calculated through reusable, centralized measures.
- **Scalability**: New products or SKUs can be added without rewriting formulas.
- **Actionable Insights**: Each visualization is powered by metrics that directly connect production, inventory, and demand.

This approach allows stakeholders to **understand performance at a glance**, while also enabling deeper drill-down analysis when needed.
  
## 👤 About the Creator
This dashboard was built as part of a **learning and portfolio project** to demonstrate **analytical thinking, Power BI modeling, and real-world business insight** in the context of frozen bakery production & inventory management.

## 🧠 Why This Dashboard Matters
In real-world FMCG operations, even small fluctuations in production or temporary equipment downtime can quickly lead to **underfilled orders, higher scrap, or overutilized capacity**. This dashboard demonstrates **month-to-month variability**, giving decision-makers **insight into corrective actions**: resource reallocation, maintenance scheduling, or production planning adjustments. Supports **data-driven inventory & production management**, highlighting both efficiency gaps and recovery opportunities.
